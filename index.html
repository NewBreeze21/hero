        <h2>About Kratos</h2>
        <p>I am Kratos, the God of War, a relentless force whose past is etched in the blood of gods and titans alike. From the ashes of Sparta, I emerged, fueled by vengeance and a burning desire to break free from the chains of fate. My journey has taken me through realms, battling mythical beasts, and toppling deities. I am a Spartan warrior, a slayer of gods, a father haunted by the sins of my past. My blades, the Chains of Olympus, carry the weight of my wrath, and my quest for redemption knows no bounds. In a world steeped in chaos and betrayal, I stand as a symbol of indomitable strength, a ghost of Sparta who will not be forgotten.</p>

    <!-- Friends -->
    <h2>Krato's Friends</h2>
    <p>Friends? Bah, gods betrayed me, mortals tremble at my name, and family... well, that's a complicated tale. Mimir, the head I carried around, was more of a talking encyclopedia than a buddy. In this harsh world of gods and monsters, alliances are fleeting, and I find myself mostly on a solitary path, carving through chaos with the Blades of Chaos. Friendship is a luxury I can ill afford in the business of war and revenge.</p>
